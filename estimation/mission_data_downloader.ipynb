This table is constructed based on the [Cassini Titan Gravity Science Table](https://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/Cassini/Cassini/RSS%20PDS%20page%202019-01-23/rss/TI_12.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Define the name of your `custom_input_mission`;\n",
    "- Add a `custom_meta_kernel_url` associated to the `custom_input_mission`;\n",
    "- Add a `custom_meta_kernel_pattern`  (or name, if you already know what's the exact name of the **meta-kernel** to be downloaded!);\n",
    "- Add the `custom_kernels_url` where kernels for your custom input mission are stored;\n",
    "- Define the `custom_local_path` where you want to store your data;\n",
    "- Call the `get_mission_files` function as done for other missions already, and do not forget the **flag**: `all_meta_kernel_files`;\n",
    "- Get popcorns, it's gonna take a while! 🍿"
